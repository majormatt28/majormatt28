All I wish to do is try my best in everything I learn and help those who are going through a similar journey.

Currently I'm not in any prject as of yet. Just working on better understanding React syntax and hooks.\
In the comming of weeks I will be doing a fullstack project based on the curiculum I have at my current coding bootcamp.
